Welcome to the repository for the [water node website](waternode.ciroh.org)! The water node website is a collaborative effort between CIROH, NOAA CoastWatch, and the National Water Center. The purpose of the website will be to intake and disseminate remote sensing data relevant to hydrological modeling, prediction, and analysis. The data will come from a variety of sources from within NOAA, CIROH, as well as potentially other agencies and companies. This data will be disseminated to CIROH researchers, Water Center operations, and the general public.

The other main purpose of the website is to serve as an educational platform and facilitator for the use of satellite imagery so that stakeholders that aren't experts in the processing and acquisition of remote sensing data can still use satellite imagery in their research efforts.
