Welcome to the Water Prediction Node! You can access geospatial data related to inland water using our [data catalog](/data-access). If you would like to learn more about how to work with this data try one of our [tutorials](/tools-and-training). The Water Node also develops [projects](/tools-and-training) focusing on data and/or tooling relevant to specific hydrological prediction and analysis tasks.
